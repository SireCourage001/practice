A method in JavaScript is a function that's associated with certain values or objects. An example you've already encountered is the .log() method, which is part of the console object
<!--.push() method. This allows you to "push" a value to the end of an array
    
.pop() method. It removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
}
  
The iterator is a variable you can declare specifically in your for loop to control how the loop iterates or goes through your logic.

Special escape sequence \n, which is interpreted as a new line when the string is logged.

JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML. You can access the HTML using the document object, which represents your entire HTML document.

One method for finding specific elements in your HTML is using the querySelector() method. The querySelector() method takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches that selector.

<!--
The innerText property controls the text that appears in an HTML element.-->

<!--
Use (\"\")the sign in brcket should contain word you wnt to give double quote

Objects are an important data type in JavaScript.
Objects are non primitive data types that store key-value pairs. Non primitive data types are mutable data types that are not undefined, null, boolean, number, string, or symbol. Mutable means that the data can be changed after it is created.
