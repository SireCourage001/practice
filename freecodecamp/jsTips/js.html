A method in JavaScript is a function that's associated with certain values or objects. An example you've already encountered is the .log() method, which is part of the console object
<!--.push() method. This allows you to "push" a value to the end of an array
    
.pop() method. It removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
}
  
The iterator is a variable you can declare specifically in your for loop to control how the loop iterates or goes through your logic.

Special escape sequence \n, which is interpreted as a new line when the string is logged.
